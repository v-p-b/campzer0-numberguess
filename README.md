Number guessing game with expensive answers
===========================================

At [CampZer0](https://camp.hsbp.org/2013/zer0/) we tried to figure out how one could optimize the process of a time-based blind SQL injection if "succeeding" queries take a long time to execute. We wrote a small simulation script to measure the efficiency of different strategies, but couldn't figure out a convincing solution. 

So we [turned to the smart people of Mathematics Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/488869/number-guessing-game-with-expensive-answers/) with a slightly rephrased problem, and after 3 years we got an [answer](http://math.stackexchange.com/a/1918211/93994). Although we can't verify the correctnes of the calculation, the simulated results look convincing :)
